# pyTimer
Python Timer class

### Required Python packages

pandas

uuid

time

os


### Uses
I am using the timer, to track a process from beginning to end, and to see the length of each process. It is a simple class, that I made so I could understand how the timer worked when I was using it. 

This can be used to log times of processes in python.
